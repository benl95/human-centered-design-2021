# Human Centered Design

In het vak Human Centered Design gaan we dingen ontwerpen voor echte mensen. Is
er goede interactie? Kan je 'mens' je product op een prettige manier bedienen?
Wat voor principes heb je gebruikt en getest? En is het leuk?

## Leerdoelen

-  _Leren hoe je (design) principles in een ontwerp kan toepassen._
-  _User needs begrijpen en gebruiken in je ontwerp._
-  _Leren hoe je moet testen en de resultaten gebruiken voor het verbeteren van
   je ontwerp._

## Debriefing

The case I got assigned to is that of Darice de Cuba. Darice has become deaf at
a late age which means she has a rememberance of speech and sounds. A hobby of
hers is to watch films and Netflix, but the problem she has been experiencing
because of her inability to hear, is that a lot of nuance is lost while watching
the film. A lot of movies offer closed captions but these are so neutral that
the context and emotion behind certain words is lost.

**Design Challenge**

How can we design closed captions in a way that the tension and sensation from
the sound of movies isn't lost in the closed captions.

**Conclusion**

The closed captions should be minimalistic and varying in the size and weight of
the font to convey the context and emotion behind the closed captions.

**Conclusion**

Emojis shouldn't be used in closed captions to convey emotions since she is
looking at the facial expression of the actors. Colors are a good options but it
is important that a small selection with colors that make sense are used. The
contrast should be good also to make it readable. In the next variation I should
implement sound and music in the closed captions to give a better experience for
Darice.
